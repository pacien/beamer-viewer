# Pointless Viewer

_Pointless Viewer_ is a web-based viewer for _Beamer_ presentations, allowing slides and speaker notes to be displayed on separate screens without the need of any configuration.

It runs in most modern web browsers, which makes it cross-platform, and does not require any special software to be installed.


## Usage

An instance of this web application is deployed at [pointlessviewer.pacien.org](https://pointlessviewer.pacien.org/). It is offline-enabled, and thus available locally even in the absence of network connectivity.

A double-width presentation may be generated with _Beamer_ using `\setbeameroption{show notes on second screen=right}`.

A demonstration is available [here](https://pointlessviewer.pacien.org/?file=sample/demo.pdf).
